Disclaimer: This bot is still in a early stage.<br>
Please expect (rare) crashes and performance problems until the bot is mature enough.

This project will probably never reach more than a D on GoReportCard because I don't like gofmt's style and will most likely never adopt it until it allows 4 spaces instead of tabs.

The primary reason for having GoReportCard at all are the go_vet, gocyclo, ineffassign and misspell tests.<br>
You are forced to keep the score as-is or improve it when making contributions to the project.
<hr/>

I'd prefer if you don't run a copy of Karen "on premises".<br>
The source code is mostly provided for educational purposes and transparency.<br>
If you still want to run her yourself please ping me on discord.<br>
The setup is not as trivial as intended so you might need some help from me.

Karen is a highly efficient, multipurpose [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) bot written in [Go](http://golang.org/).
