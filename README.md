### How does this work?? TL;DR?
I've drawn a colorful picture just for you!

### Docs
Hancrafted guide soon (tm)

Until then use GoWalker/GoDoc for coding guides and
the homepage for usage help.

### Invite
Public invite link is coming after the private beta ends.

Want access?<br>
Register here: https://goo.gl/forms/9J9GYMg8c9IM6a5Z2

### Disclaimer
This bot is still in a early stage.<br>
Please expect (rare) crashes and minor performance problems until the bot is mature enough.

### Selfhosted Bot
I'd prefer if you don't run a copy of Karen "on premises".<br>
The source code is mostly provided for educational purposes and transparency.<br>
If you still want to run her yourself please ping me on discord.<br>
The setup is not as trivial as intended so you might need some help from me.

### About the bad GoReportCard score
This project will probably never reach more than a D on GoReportCard because I hugely disagree on gofmt's decision to use tabs instead of spaces. I know that this discussion is as old as programming itself, but this is my opinion on this. I prefer spaces. Always. I might create a fork of gofmt that allows spaces at some point.

The primary reason for having GoReportCard at all are the go_vet, gocyclo, ineffassign and misspell tests.<br>
You are forced to keep the score as-is or improve it when making contributions to the project.
