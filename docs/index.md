[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sn0w/Karen.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sn0w/Karen)

Karen is a highgly efficient, multipurpose [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) bot written in [Rust](http://rust-lang.org/).<br>

A design goal was to keep the experience with her non-intrusive.
That means there are currently neither modules for moderation/administration nor plans to make them.
However since Karen supports modules you can extend her to infinity!

This site is an effort to collect all docs related to the bot including a list of commands, API docs and guides.<br>
The docs are still *very* WiP, so if you find missing content please open an issue on [GitHub](http://github.com/sn0w/karen)
