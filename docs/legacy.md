Shiro is a kinda efficient, multipurpose [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) bot written in [Groovy](http://groovy-lang.org/).<br>

### Can I suggest features/commands/...?
Nope.
Only Karen will receive new features.

### Are you kidding? Java is everything but not efficient...
I am not.<br>
Even while Playing music shiro only consumes about 32mb RAM\* and a few percent CPU.<br>
That's less than one open tab in Google Chrome.<br>
I archieved this by dumping runtime audio conversions.<br>
Shiro utilizes FFMPEG/libav and opusenc to process your audio **before** sending it to discord.<br>

<sub>*\*In-Use heap. Results may vary depending on JVM version and active Garbage Collector.*</sub>
### Requirements
- Any OS and CPU that runs Java 8 [or Docker]
- About 32mb of free RAM
- About 20mb of free HDD space [The docker image needs additional 250mb]
- A MySQL server (anywhere. Maybe at bplaced? ðŸ˜…)
- FFMPEG/libav, youtube-dl and opusenc if you want to use the Music module
- Internet connection, duh

### Docker? Docker!
Just do a 
```
docker run -dv /docker/shiro:/data --link <mysql-container>:mysql sn0w/shiro:<full commit id or branch name>
```
and everything is ready! :)

### Notable Mentions (<3)
Shiro wouldn't exist without these awesome pieces of software!
